h1. Quote extraction demo

A simple project to demonstrate the use of maximum entropy models for extracting quotes from news articles. Also includes a pretty quote browser that cycles through quotes from Bay Citizen content.

h2. Includes

* A workflow and class wrapper for training, evaluating and applying NLTK maximum entropy models to quote detection.
* A demonstration of OpenCalais for coreference detection.
* Basic Django admin interface for training a classifier.
* A simple public-facing quote browser interface.
* Sample data so you can see how everything comes together.

h2. Getting started

The demo is designed to work out of the box with an included SQLite database. To get up and running, simply:

<pre><code>git clone git@github.com:cirlabs/citizen-quotes.git
cd citizen-quotes
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd quotex
python manage.py runserver
</code></pre>

The quote browser will be running in your browser at 127.0.0.1:8000.
