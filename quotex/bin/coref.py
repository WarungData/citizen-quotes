coref.py

Uses OpenCalais for pronoun coreference resolution. In this case, works
by just assigning entities to their associated paragraphs.

Another option would be to train a coreference detector using the coref
module in nltk_contrib (https://github.com/nltk/nltk_contrib). But the
module seems to count on the MUC6 corpus for training, and the MUC6 corpus
ain't free: http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/catalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2003T13

Calais was the cheap and easy way to start, which works fine for demo purposes.

def _get_people(text):
    '''
    Runs input text through Calais to extract people, coreferences and their
    locations.

    This function returns a canonical name for any given source in the document
    and contextual information about where coreferences appear, based on the
    text before and after the pronoun occurrance.

    Takes full story text as input.

    This is a pretty bare-bones function. It doesn't handle Calais API errors, so 
    it tends to crap out from time to time. Future refinements should account for this.

def resolve_pronouns(story):
    '''
    Function to resolve pronouns given our particularly funky use case.

    This function takes a full story text and resolves pronouns within the individual
    paragraph objects that make up that text. It's set up this way because our system's
    main unit of content is the paragraph, not the story.

    These nested loops are an awfully inefficient way of resolving pronouns. Would be great
    to see it cleaned up. But again, for demo purposes, works just fine.
